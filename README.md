# chord-implementation
chord implementation in java.
You can add nodes, remove nodes and check finger table of every node.
The implementation is partly based on the algorithm provided in wikipedia and partly implemented on my own.
It also contains eclipse attack, which is a static code.

# do i need multiple systems?
You can run them eclipse attack and chord protocol seperately and both the codes don't need multiple pc/laptops as it is does not use socket programming.
